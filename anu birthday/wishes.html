				<p>Hey Anu, Wish you a very happy birthday dear ❤
			We met just 3 years back, but it feels like we've been friends since quiet a long time.
			Being unknown people from day 1 at hostel to being very good friends we have came a long way.
			Our night outs, our sunday parties, our momo sessions were best.
			I've always loved your "Helping everyone" quality (though it has some disadvantages too 😂).
			And we love you the way you are❤. Don't change for anyone.

					Happy birthday Anushree❣️
					Wishing you with lots of love..
					Few lines for this 15 years of our friendship.. 

					From class one to the last one... 
					From a new friend to a new gang.. 
					From a mischiveous to an ambitious.. 
					From dreaming big to achieving thick..    
					From Last benches to the huge trenches.. 
					From the old cheatings to new bringings..
					From the adult talks to the new walks.. 
					From the first periods to the crust pcos..
					From the new memory to the old summary.. 
					From the lowest skirts to the formal shirts.. 
					From the fashionable puffs to the classy cluffs..
					Form the faltu attitude to the sober gratitude.. 
					From the full forms to the pull norms.. 
					You will always be in our hearts.. ❣️
					N hope we could sit in that last bench again..💗
					<br>
					~Muskan
